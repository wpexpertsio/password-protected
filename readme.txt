A very simple way to quickly password protect your WordPress site with a single password.

== Description ==

A very simple way to quickly password protect your WordPress site with a single password.

This plugin only protects your WordPress generated content. It **does not protect images or uploaded files** so if you enter and exact URL to in image file it will still be accessible.

Features include:

* Password protect your WordPress site with a single password.
* Option to allow access to feeds.
* Option to allow administrators access without entering password.
* *New* üëâ Now you can customize the whole password protected screen including the background, font, logo, color e.t.c. 

> Please note, this plugin works by setting a cookie to allow access to the site. If you are using a caching plugin or web hosting such as WP Engine that has in-built caching, you will need to configure the caching service to be disabled if the Password Protected cookie is set.
