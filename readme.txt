Do you want to password protect your WordPress site to secure WordPress pages, posts, categories, etc? If so, then you need to install ‚ú®**the Password Protected plugin**‚ú®.

Additionally, you can secure the password protected screen from WordPress attacks such as a WordPress brute force attack with the limit login feature.


Therefore, the [Password Protected WordPress plugin](https://passwordprotectedwp.com/) ensures comprehensive security, covering everything from WordPress pages to WooCommerce products, all with a user-friendly interface.


== Why Do You Need to Password Protect WordPress Site? ==

With the rapidly rising number of cyber threats, having an effective WordPress security system for your website is essential.

Whether you're a blogger, a business owner, or a developer, protecting sensitive information and controlling who can access the content you have created is essential. This is where the Password Protected plugin comes in. 

**For example**, imagine you're a photographer showcasing your portfolio. By using the Password Protect WordPress plugin, you can share your work securely with potential clients. Simply password protect your portfolio page, and only those with the password can view it. It's an easy way to keep your photos private until you're ready to share them publicly.


### What Makes the Password Protected Plugin Stand Out! üòé

Wouldn't you like to have WordPress password protection that gives you peace of mind and immense security for your WordPress site‚ùì

Here are some of the features of the password protect WordPress plugin that gives so much control over your WordPress content protection while protecting your site from unauthorized access. 


== ‚ö° Password Protect Entire WordPress Site With These Features: ==

**‚úÖ Complete Site Protection ‚ÄîüíØ% FREE**

Want to protect your entire WordPress site? Password Protected plugin makes it easy!  

With a single master password, password protect entire WordPress site to prevent unauthorized access. Also, set how long you want to use the password, define protected permission, and much more.

**‚úÖ Passwordless Admin Access**

As an admin, you probably don't want the hassle of entering additional passwords to access your site. Right? 

Don't worry. With the Password Protected plugin, you can simplify the login process for administrators with Passwordless Admin Access. This time-saving functionality enhances efficiency and security by eliminating the need for administrators to manage passwords or risk exposure to unauthorized access attempts.

**‚úÖ Add Google Recaptcha**

Make your password protected screen more secure by integrating Google reCaptcha. The plugin supports both Google reCAPTCHA v2 and v3.

Google reCAPTCHA prevents automated bots and spam by presenting users with challenges that only humans can solve, such as identifying objects in images or solving puzzles.

**‚úÖ IP Address Whitelisting**

You can specify which IP addresses can access password protected content with IP Address Whitelisting. 

This feature adds an extra layer of security by preventing unauthorized access from IP addresses not included on the whitelist so that only approved users can access protected content.

**‚úÖ Specific Post/Page Protection**

Do you have premium content or sensitive information that you want to restrict access to? With the Password Protected plugin, you can easily password protect WordPress pages or posts so that only authorized users can view them. This feature allows you to offer exclusive content to subscribers or conduct private testing before publication.

Check out our guide on how to [password protect WordPress page](https://passwordprotectedwp.com/wordpress-password-protect-page/) the right way.

**‚úÖ User Role Whitelisting**

If you are looking for simplified access control based on user roles. The User Role Whitelisting is the solution you need. By whitelisting certain user roles for your WordPress site, such as administrators, editors, or subscribers, you can ensure that authorized users can view protected content without entering a password.

**‚úÖ WP-Admin Protection**

Password protect wp-login (WordPress admin login page) against unauthorized access. This feature adds an extra layer of security by requiring a password to access the WP-admin dashboard, giving you greater protection against unauthorized login attempts and a [WordPress brute force attack](https://passwordprotectedwp.com/wordpress-brute-force-attack/).

When you password protect WordPress login page (WP-admin area), it prevents unauthorized users from accessing sensitive site settings, user data, and administrative functions. This is particularly important for sites with multiple administrators or contributors, as it helps prevent unauthorized changes to site settings or content.

**‚úÖ Password Attempt Activity Report (Weekly)**

Gain valuable insights into user interactions with your protected content through our exclusive Password Attempt Activity Report. This report will provide a comprehensive overview of login attempts, including successful and failed tries, browsers utilized, and recent activity logs. Whether using the Free or Pro version, this report enables you to track login attempts and user activity efficiently.

**‚úÖ Custom Post Type Protection**

Extend your site's security beyond standard posts and pages. Password Protected plugin allows you to secure any custom post type, such as portfolios, testimonials, or products. The feature is extremely useful for businesses or creatives looking to share proprietary content or offer exclusive access to certain areas of their site.

**‚úÖ Category/Taxonomy Protection**

Password protect WordPress categories to take control of your site's organization and access. Using single or multiple passwords, you can lock specific categories or taxonomies, along with related post tags.

This functionality is ideal for websites with diverse content categories or membership tiers. By restricting access to certain categories, you can create exclusive areas for different user groups or offer premium content to subscribers.

**‚úÖ Certain Page/Posts Exclusions**

Maintain flexibility in your WordPress site's accessibility by excluding specific pages, posts, and post types from password protection. Whether it's your homepage, contact page, or landing page, you can ensure that certain content remains accessible to all visitors while securing entire website content with a password.

**‚úÖ Limit Login Attempts**

Set up a limit for login attempts to protect your WordPress password protected screen against the most common WordPress attacks, such as brute force attacks. The Password Protected [limit login attempts](https://passwordprotectedwp.com/limit-login-attempts/) feature is a proactive measure that mitigates the risk of unauthorized access and strengthens overall site security.

**‚úÖ Password Expiration and Usage Limit**

If you want to password protect WordPress pages/posts for a certain period, set expiration dates and impose usage limits to restrict the number of times a user can use the password. This will make your site more secure and make it easier to manage user access.

**‚úÖ Bypass URL**

Want to share password protected content with someone without sharing the password? The Bypass URL feature enables you to do just that. You can create unique URLs that remain accessible to the users without requiring a password.

**‚úÖ Detailed Activity Logs**

Stay informed and vigilant with detailed activity logs for every password attempt. This feature provides comprehensive insights into site activity, including IP addresses, dates, times, and login statuses, so you can easily monitor and review user interactions.

**‚úÖ Lock Screen Customization**

Make a lasting impression on visitors with a personalized and professional lock screen. With our Login Designer plugin, you can customize the appearance of your password-protected screen to align with your brand identity and aesthetics.

With options to customize the background, logo, and other elements of the lock screen, you can create a cohesive and visually appealing experience for users seeking access to your protected content.

**‚úÖ Multiple Password Management**

Experience unmatched flexibility and control over access permissions with Multiple Password Management. You can create unlimited passwords for any lock screen. It is also easy to activate or deactivate multiple passwords for various purposes, from testing to membership management.
