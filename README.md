Password Protected
==================

A very simple way to quickly password protect your WordPress site with a single password.

This plugin only protects your WordPress generated content. It **does not protect images or uploaded files** so if you enter and exact URL to in image file it will still be accessible.

Features include:

- Password protect your WordPress site with a single password.
- Option to allow access to feeds.
- Option to allow administrators access without entering password.
- *New* ðŸ‘‰ Now you can customize the whole password protected screen including the background, font, logo, color e.t.c.

> Please note, this plugin works by setting a cookie to allow access to the site. If you are using a caching plugin or web hosting such as WP Engine that has in-built caching, you will need to configure the caching service to be disabled if the Password Protected cookie is set.
